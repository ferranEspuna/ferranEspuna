# Ferran Espuña: Deep Learning Research Engineer, Mathematician and Computer Scientist

## About Me
I have a double degree in mathematics and computer science and am currently working in the field of artificial intelligence research. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems of any kind and am very curious, hard-working, and proactive given the right motivations. I work well both independently, as a leader, and as a part of a team.

## Professional Experience

### Barcelona Supercomputing Center | Research Engineer
**2023 - Present**  
As a Deep Learning Research Engineer for Language Technologies, my main work focuses on Large Language Models. So far, my work has involved:

- Building and automating [CURATE](https://github.com/langtech-bsc/CURATE), a text processing pipeline designed to work in High Performance Computing environments and used to create [CATalog](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/CATalog), the largest pretraining dataset in Catalan.
- Actively participating in design decisions and writing pretraining scripts for the [Salamandra models](https://huggingface.co/collections/BSC-LT/salamandra-66fc171485944df79469043a), a collection of highly multilingual language models pretrained from scratch using the Marenostrum 5 cluster.
- Researching ways to better evaluate the performance of our language models in open generation settings (not multiple choice).
- Opening research lines such as those for alternatives to Transformers (SSMs in particular) and mechanistic interpretability techniques (in particular, Sparse Autoencoders).

### Computer Vision Center | Research Intern
**2022**  
Awarded a fully funded research internship at CVC, which also served as an opportunity to develop my Bachelor’s Thesis.

- **Research Topic**: Application of Topological Data Analysis methods to study the generalization capabilities of neural networks.
- **Supervisors**: Professor Sergio Escalera (CVC), Professor Carles Casacuberta, and Rubén Ballester.

### ChipScope Research Group at UB | Image Processing
**2022**  
Contributed to the European research project ChipScope aimed at creating a high-resolution microscope the size of a computer chip. My work involved:

- Controlling the illumination and camera of the microscope to take image samples from effectively different points of view.
- Aligning and blending the images through computer vision techniques to produce a global view of the samples.
- Implementing wave backpropagation algorithms to remove interference artifacts caused by the small scale of the setup.
- Designing a user interface to make the process user-friendly.


## Education

### Master’s degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering | UPC
**Expected Graduation**: June 2025

- Courses so far: Commutative Algebra, Number Theory, Coding Theory, Cryptography, Combinatorics and Graph Theory.
- Currently working on my master’s thesis on Algorithmic Extremal Graph and Hypergraph Theory.

### Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science | UB
**February 2023**

- GPA: 9.0/10
- Achieved honors in courses like Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Distributed Software, Databases, Advanced Algorithms, Numerical Methods, and Differential Equations, among many others.

## Publications

### A CURATEd CATalog: Rethinking the Extraction of Pretraining Corpora for Mid-Resourced Languages
Proceedings of the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation, European Language Resource Association and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics.

## Personal Projects

- Developed a [neural network](https://github.com/ferranEspuna/machineLearning/blob/main/neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb) from scratch, enhancing understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and gradient descent.
- Created visualizations for various 2D fractals and physical simulations.
- Designed a framework for 3D visualization of [polynomial zeros](https://github.com/ferranEspuna/Grafics_P1/blob/main/Modelling/Objects/PolynomialEq.cpp) through raytracing, applying my knowledge of Computer Graphics and Differential Geometry.
