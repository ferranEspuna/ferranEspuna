# Ferran Espuña: Deep Learning Research Engineer, Mathematician and Computer Scientist

## About Me
I have a double Bachelor's Degree in mathematics and computer science, and a Master's Degree in Advanced Mathematics. I am currently working in artificial intelligence research. I excel at proposing novel solutions to challenging problems, and have the technical skills to execute them and overcome obstacles independently, while coordingating as part of a larger team.

## Professional Experience

### Barcelona Supercomputing Center | Research Engineer
**2023 - Present**  
As a Deep Learning Research Engineer for Language Technologies, my main work focuses on Large Language Models. So far, my work has involved:

- Building and automating [CURATE](https://github.com/langtech-bsc/CURATE), a text processing pipeline designed to work in High Performance Computing environments and used to create [CATalog](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/CATalog), the largest pretraining dataset in Catalan.
- Actively participating in design decisions and writing pretraining scripts for the [Salamandra models](https://huggingface.co/collections/BSC-LT/salamandra-66fc171485944df79469043a), a collection of highly multilingual language models pretrained from scratch using the Marenostrum 5 cluster.
- Researching ways to better evaluate the performance of our language models in open generation settings.
- Opening research lines such as those for alternatives to Transformers (SSMs in particular) and mechanistic interpretability techniques (in particular, Sparse Autoencoders).
- Designing and experimenting with new architectures for better and more efficient multimodal models.

### Computer Vision Center | Research Intern
**2022**  
Awarded a fully funded research internship at CVC, which also served as an opportunity to develop my Bachelor’s Thesis.

- **Research Topic**: Application of Topological Data Analysis methods to study the generalization capabilities of neural networks.
- **Supervisors**: Professor Sergio Escalera (CVC), Professor Carles Casacuberta, and Rubén Ballester.

### ChipScope Research Group at UB | Image Processing
**2022**  
Contributed to the European research project ChipScope aimed at creating a high-resolution microscope the size of a computer chip. My work involved:

- Controlling the illumination and camera of the microscope to take image samples from effectively different points of view.
- Aligning and blending the images through computer vision techniques to produce a global view of the samples.
- Implementing wave backpropagation algorithms to remove interference artifacts caused by the small scale of the setup.
- Designing a user interface to make the process user-friendly.


## Education

### Master’s degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering | UPC
**June 2025**

- Courses so far: Commutative Algebra, Number Theory, Coding Theory, Cryptography, Combinatorics and Graph Theory.
- Master's Thesis: Finding Partite Hypergraphs Efficiently. In it, I apply elementary results in extremal graph theory to create a polynomial-time algorithm that finds large k-partite subgraphs of k-graphs, generating a construction that asymptotically matches the best known bounds for existence.
  
### Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science | UB
**February 2023**

- GPA: 9.0/10
- Achieved honors in courses like Linear Algebra, Algebraic Equations, Complex and Real Analysis, Differential Equations, Advanced Algorithms, and my Bachelor's Thesis, among many others.
